Upon opening the website, we only get

Where the interesting thing is Werkzeug 1.0.1. However, exploits for Werkzeug only work for versions 0.9 and earlier.

However, given the page runs Jinja2, and the title of the challenge is Template, it's a fair assumption that it relates to Jinja2's common SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) vulnerability.

One way to look for this is to input something at the end of the URL:

Pay attention to the fact that it returns our exact input back to us.

**Templating**
Template in a Web-context is used when only minor things change  on a page from circumstance to circumstance.
For instance a to-do-list-webpage might have a link like this:
``www.myToDoList.com/work
That shows a todolist with the title "work", and a link:
``www.myToDoList.com/home``
That shows a todolist with the title "home".

**SSTI**
However, this can be exploited. We know that the server uses our page's input. With certain payloads, we can essentially RCE.

We make use of MRO (Method Resolution Order) to traverse up the request library in Python (since it is written in Flask) to import "os library". And once we have access to that, we have shell access.

We take the payload:
``{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}``
