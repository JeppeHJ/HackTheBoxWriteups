Description of this challenge goes:
	``A Junior Developer just switched to a new source control platform. Can you find the secret token?``

And we are provided with "bot.JS" and "config.json". The JavaScript file is a fairly simple Discord bot with very little functionality. 

Glancing over the code, we find an interesting line at the very bottom:

```javascript
client.login(Buffer.from(config.token, 'base64').toString('ascii')) 
//Login with secret token
```

Looking at the config variable:
```javascript
var config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./config.json"));
```
We see it parses from the JSON file. So we decide to take a look:
```json
		"token": "Replace me with token when in use! Security Risk!",
        "prefix": "~",
        "lightNum": "1337",
        "username": "UmVkIEhlcnJpbmcsIHJlYWQgdGhlIEpTIGNhcmVmdWxseQ==",
        "host": "127.0.0.1"
```
Not much we can use from here. We decide to look for hidden files, potentially a .git that contains earlier versions of the code:
``ls -la``
We ls with the -la tag because we know the .git is a hidden directory. And yep, a .git appears.
Taking a look at the reflog after running:
``git init``
Shows us that theres a commit message with the very revealing:
``"Removed the secret token"
We then ``git revert`` to that commit ID, and woila we have the flag.
